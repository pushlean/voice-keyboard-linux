# STT Toggle Implementation Summary

âœ… **BUILD STATUS: SUCCESSFUL** - All code compiles without errors or warnings!

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **Dependencies Added** (Cargo.toml)
- `tray-icon = "0.17"` - System tray icon support
- `global-hotkey = "0.6"` - Global keyboard shortcuts
- `parking_lot = "0.12"` - Efficient locks for shared state
- `gtk = "0.18"` - GTK library for tray icon (required on Linux)

### 2. **New Module: tray_icon.rs**
Created a complete system tray icon manager with:
- Visual indicator (green = active, red = inactive)
- Menu items: "Toggle STT (Super+X)" and "Quit"
- Icon updates when state changes
- Event handling for menu clicks

### 3. **Modified: main.rs**
Completely refactored the `run_stt` function to support:
- Shared state management with `Arc<Mutex<bool>>`
- Global hotkey registration (Super+X)
- Dynamic audio recording start/stop
- Event loop for handling hotkey and tray icon events
- Application starts in inactive mode (not listening)
- Toggle switches between active/inactive states

### 4. **Modified: stt_client.rs**
- Added `#[derive(Clone)]` to `AudioBuffer` to support multiple recording sessions

### 5. **GTK Initialization** (main.rs)
- Added `gtk::init()` call at the beginning of `run_stt`
- Integrated GTK event processing in the main event loop
- Calls `gtk::main_iteration_do()` to process tray icon events

### 6. **Updated Documentation**
- README.md now includes:
  - New features (toggle control, tray icon)
  - Updated prerequisites (GTK3, libxdo)
  - Usage instructions for toggle functionality
  - Wayland limitations for global hotkeys
  - Troubleshooting section
- Updated shell.nix and flake.nix with GTK dependencies

## How It Works

1. **Application starts** in inactive mode (not listening)
2. **Press Super+X** or click tray icon to toggle listening on/off
3. **When active** (green icon):
   - Audio recording starts
   - Speech is transcribed and typed
4. **When inactive** (red icon):
   - Audio recording completely stops
   - No system resources used for audio

## Installation Steps

### 1. Install System Dependencies

**Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt install libgtk-3-dev libxdo-dev pkg-config libasound2-dev
```

**Fedora/RHEL:**
```bash
sudo dnf install gtk3-devel libxdo-devel alsa-lib-devel
```

**Arch:**
```bash
sudo pacman -S gtk3 libxdo alsa-lib
```

### 2. Build the Project

```bash
cd /home/pshen/open-src/voice-keyboard-linux
cargo build
```

### 3. Run the Application

```bash
# Set your Deepgram API key
export DEEPGRAM_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"

# Run with sudo -E to preserve environment
sudo -E ./target/debug/voice-keyboard
```

## Usage

1. Run the application - it starts in **inactive** mode
2. Look for the **red icon** in your system tray
3. Press **Super+X** (or click the tray icon) to start listening
4. Icon turns **green** when active
5. Press **Super+X** again to stop listening

## Known Limitations

### Wayland Global Hotkeys
- Global hotkeys on Wayland have experimental support
- May not work on all compositors
- If Super+X doesn't work, use the tray icon instead
- Works reliably on X11

### System Tray
- Requires GTK3 on Linux
- Should work on most desktop environments (GNOME, KDE, XFCE, etc.)

## Testing

To test the implementation without the STT service:

```bash
# Test audio input
sudo -E ./target/debug/voice-keyboard --test-audio

# Test STT with toggle functionality (default)
sudo -E ./target/debug/voice-keyboard
```

## Troubleshooting

### Build fails with GTK errors
- Make sure GTK3 development packages are installed
- Run `pkg-config --exists gtk+-3.0 && echo "OK" || echo "NOT FOUND"`

### Hotkey doesn't work
- On Wayland, use the tray icon instead
- Check if your compositor supports global hotkeys
- Works reliably on X11

### No tray icon appears
- Check if your desktop environment supports system tray
- GNOME requires an extension for tray icons
- Try KDE or XFCE if issues persist
